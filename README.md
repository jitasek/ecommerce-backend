# E-Commerce Back End (ORM)

This app builds the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. The task is to configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## User Story

As a manager at an internet retail company
I want a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies so that my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a functional Express.js API:
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize.

WHEN I enter schema and seed commands, a development database is created and is seeded with test data.

WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application, my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.

WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
